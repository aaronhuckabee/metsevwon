Final Prettiness Assessment 
    wonders need to show all available stages, no more, no less (rhodes, giza)
    filter colored cardgroups by age, so that only the latest has an offset,
    because inheritence doesn't need to be seen when it's past available. Need
    colorful box shadows everywhere!!!!
Final Semantic Assessment
Profile different tasks when performed in different ways
